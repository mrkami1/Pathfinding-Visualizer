# Pathfinding-Visualizer
C# based pathfinder that is made to visualize how the A* and Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms function

## Controls
Use the **Algorithm** drop down to select the desired pathfinding method

The **Node** drop down allows you to select which node type you want to change. The **Wall** nodes are used to place obstacles in between the **Start** and **End** nodes.
**Start** and **End** are used to move the starting/ending point of the selected algorithm

Nodes can be placed with the **Left Mouse Button** and removed with the **Right Mouse Button** 

The yellow path is the path that the chosen algorithm has found.
